# CytenaStopWatch
Coding Challenge for interview on 22.10.

# Coding Challenge

You shall develop a stop-watch client server solution satisfying the following requirements:

* The backend maintains a single stop watch instance
* Multiple clients can connect to the backend and start or stop the stopwatch.
* Every client is displaying the current stopwatch timer (One timer for all clients) and the current state (running, stopped)
* Client and server shall use REST, grpc or a comparable protocol for communication. Explain your choice (Experience is also a reason ;)
* The backend service shall be developed with C# .NET Core
* The client can be developed in any technology (C# Desktop, Browser based ....)
* Document how to run and demonstrate your solution in a readme file.
* Commit your code to a git repository and make it available to us
* You have one week to complete your task

Do not focus on UI. It is not important to present a nice UI. It's about software design, clean code and architecture. Think about testability. How would you test your solution. Be prepared to explain your solution.
